CPSC651  Phase5  Team 7  Paper:
1. Lots of data about rides --- Source Lat.Long ,Dest Lat.Long, Fare, and more --- > big Data
2. Individual ---> Find the top driver based on most Distance Travelled , Most Fare Collected(Total Amount), Most Time travelled , Most efficient Driver User Reviews 
3. Region Wise --> Find the top Pickup/Dropoff locations 
4. By Time and Location --- > Same TOp Driver and top Pickup/Dropoff sorted by each hour of day(Average COunt per hour)
5. Driver Fare Revenue ---->  Net and Gross Revenue of the Driver Per Hour
6. Did anaylsis to find out the most efficient driver and region which should be target for providing better cab services and also by time of the day.



uber_pricing: 
UBER'S DYNAMIC PRICING --- Try to make it transparent and beneficial to the consumers
Comparing the Yellow City Cabs with UberX
1. Uber charging more for shorter trips than longer ones thus maintaining a balance in revenue collection.
2.Observing the pattern of human use of cabs and making the model.
3. SHorter trips more frequent and thus using this to collect more revenue.
4. For same lat long OD pair we compare pricing the yellow city vs Uber X(Took mean of low and high estimate)
5.Uber's Pricing considers a balance between the driver supply and customer demand . Like Manhattan , expensive area less drivers more customers --- > High Prone to SURCHARGE
6. First --->> How does surge pricing manifest in the city over time and space? 
7. Second---->> Can we exploit different data sources to predict Uber’s surge pricing patterns?
8. Surge pricing patterns :: 
a) the price value of a single route can vary significantly over time(Surge periods for over few hours)
b)At same time some area surge pricing other still base price bcoz of diff. customer demand vs driver supply in diff. regions.
c)Experiment. 
Fix Origin and correlation b/w time series of queries at that region with surcharge/base charge time series ---> strong dependence (0.96)
Fix Destination and correlation b/w time series of queries at that region with surcharge/base charge time series ---> less dependence (0.57) (Uber
would benefit from having their drivers move to areas with a high demand.)
9. Geographic hierarchy of surge pricing :: Finding areas prone to surge pricing.Use (average surge multiplier) ,central and dense areas are more prone to surge, associated to a higher average multiplier.
10. rank areas from higher to lower surge values. :: Assume uniform driver supply and collect customer demand data from diff cab companies and compare.So estimate demand, find popular destinations get an idea abt. population density using diff. datasets.
Supervised Training :: y ---> surcharge multiplier
					x(i) --- >>demand data collected at area i
					Train the model-- > Estimate the surcharge multiplier of the area
Correlation B/w diff. areas found out now and compared.

1. Plot the pickup and dropoff into a map and anaylzed the regions having most acivity also seen the yellow and green taxis.
2. Brooklyn---Rise of Uber between June 2014 and June 2015, the number of Uber pickups in Brooklyn grew by 525%
3. Uber made 1.4 million more Manhattan pickups in June 2015 than it did in June 2014, while taxis made 1.1 million fewer pickups. 
4.However, even though Uber picked up nearly 2 million Manhattan passengers in June 2015, Uber still accounts for less than 15% of total Manhattan pickups.
5.Analyzed time taken to reach different airports.
6. Weather Affect Taxi and Uber Ridership---
Uber was more often used in snowfall and precipitation.Uber is well-known for its surge pricing during times of high demand, which often includes inclement weather.
It seems,Uber’s capacity seems less negatively impacted by bad weather relative to taxi capacity.(Still no comments)
7.10 PM and 5 AM --- Late night
8.More payment with credit cards (Increasing Day by Day)

(Comapre Yellow taxi vs Uber vs Lyft)
1. Plot the Graphs on their usage , Highest is Yellow and Lowest if Lyft.
2. Based on Total Vehicles on the Road , also plot. 
Yellow - constant
Uber -- maximum
Lyft -- Least
3. Lyft trips decreasing (Not sure)

1.Medallion System
2.Taxi Market Model of Medallion System
3.Uber Prices in 2016 in NYC and US (uberx mostly)
4.Ride sharing app Uber and Lyft are
5.Current Problem is old regulations which penalize these new cab sharing services that come out of techonology advancement.
